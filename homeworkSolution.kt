/*Q1 = what dose Race Conditions mean
A race condition is another type of concurrency bug that occurs when two or more threads access
shared data and try to change it at the same time.*/

/*Q2 = is there any Race Conditions in the code
The weapon vlaue could be null at the same time the weapon name printing */

/*  Q3 = what's the best way to solve the compiling error in the code using scopeFunction
When can fix it by the scopeFunction also to be guaranteed that it is will never change by any part
of the code */
